# dbt-model-dimensional
A project has been implemented to create a logical star model using the Kimball methodology with the use of DBT tool and BigQuery database. The aim of the project was to create a unified data model that could combine data from different sources and provide more efficient analysis.

To achieve the goal of the project, the following tasks were completed:

1. Studying business processes and identifying key data flows.
2. Analyzing existing data and identifying key dimensions and facts.
3. Developing a logical star model based on the identified dimensions and facts using the Kimball methodology.
4. Creating a data integration process using DBT.
5. Deploying the data model on the BigQuery platform.
6. Testing and validating the data model.
